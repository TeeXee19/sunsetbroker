            <p class="font-poppins text-black-900 font-light text-[16px] my-4">
                The journey to the real estate sector started in 2020, in the FCT Abuja, Nigeria.  I keenly observed that real estate business is very beneficial when it comes to investment as well as securing a landed property, which in turn can be a hedge against inflation. In the history of Real Estate, I realized that civil servants, middle class, average and low income earners perceive the real estate sector as a rich man's business, which made it hard for them to take advantage of this type of investment. This realization led me to register my company SUNSET REALTORS LTD in 2021, to bring a solution to what seems to be an inequality in the real estate sector.
                <br/>                
                At Sunset Realtors we are not only concerned with our customers buying from us, we are also focused on helping to facilitate those with interest but cant afford the offers on the table. With this in view, we resolved to start a co-ownership investment Scheme from land banking to being a land lord by owning a Fractional percentage of the property of interest and gaining passive income in the process.</p>
